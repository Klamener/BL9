# Note from fork author
This fork is done so it works on experimental from 26.01.2025. I dunno if it works in the future. There were some dirty hacks, also you may have problems with mon_zombie_bio_op texture when it gets obsoleted. I dunno if i maintain it in the future. Also allowed Bl9 infused soldering iron to use all batteries because of battery audit that lowered energy values.

Not updated anymore. If you want to play with it, you have to fix it yourself, preferably, via making a fork of it if you don't mind. A huge sci-fi action adventure content mod for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead along with Bright Nights greatly inspired by Resident Evil series by Capcom along with Half Life series by Valve as well 

## Prerequisites 
**None, but playing with BIG content mods (Magiclysm, Aftershock, Secronom, Xedra Evolved, Mind Over Matter, Cata++, Arcana, Blazemod) is STRONGLY ADVISED because the content of this mod is QUITE MID-GAME to END-GAME so weapons, armor and balance changes from other mods will come in handy**

**IMPORTANT - PUT ONLY ONE OUT OF 3 VERSIONS DEPENDING ON YOUR CHOSEN MONSTER_RESILIENCE MODIFIER DURING WORLD GENERATION**

## What you'll experience: main features

**1) Adds tons of structures ranging from gigantic to huge - Safety Base Central Hub with missions, huge crazed Ancient Castlelan Castle of a Cult, Abandoned Industrial Facility infested with Aliens, Secret Organization Military heavily guarded Island, various Lush and Fortified Biomes with Guard Towers, Advanced Mobile Base of Aliens with their Militia, all locations are infested by ALL kinds of monsters with GREAT rewards and bosses to fight**

**2) New guns (including huge amount of both modern and hi-tech ranged weapons - 3 tiers of modern weapons, 4 tiers of hi-tech weapons which are capable of shooting laser, plasma, acid, electricity, tons of sleek and unique craftable ammo), unique craftable and findable both classic, unique and hi-tech melee weapons (using all kinds of vanilla martial arts), new armor (4 tiers in total - 2 tiers of well-made strong BL9-infused survivor armor, 2 tiers of hi-tech BL9-infused survivor armor which buffs skills along with stats), tons of new artifacts of 3 tiers which buff skills along with stats**

**3) Dangerous monsters and bosses to fight - from cultist and heavily armed military roaming patrols to heavily mutated creatures, mutants, aliens, advanced aliens' militia and tough bosses inspired greatly by Resident Evil series by Capcom and Half Life series by Valve creatures**

**4) Carefully and well-made linear balance system thanks to Tekker - you'll be slowly going from mid-game structures and monsters to end-game truly DANGEROUS locations and bosses with lots of valuable stuff to collect and craft**

**5) Unique lore in the form of journals and notes - learn about both good and evil Secret Organizations, Vile Cult, Origin of "BL9" organism, evil plans of a vile faction called 'THEY' that wants to establish the New World Order, Strange Alien Biomes and Creatures, Advanced Alien Civilizations 'Alliance' that wants to seize this peculiar organism, learn about their their followers or exiles, learn about secret organizations' scientists, agents, workers, their goals, their motives, will you let vile and power hungry human and alien factions ravage Earth or save it?**

**6) Unique Merchant NPC system done by Axema - collect currency from BL9 monsters and buy Tier 1 and Tier 2 ranged weapons and armor - what are ya buying, stranger?**

**7) New well-made beautiful vivid and colorful terrain biome tiles support made by the great tileset maker SomeDeadGuy - truly vivid and nice looking biome terrains**

**8) Unique Herb Healing system done by me - You can instantly heal a certain part of your HP while in combat but be careful to not overdo it in combat - you get a stacking temporary debuff which gets only longer the more you use the herbs**

**9) Bright Nights versions support - NO errors, working perfectly fine - get it here https://github.com/Kenan2000/BrightNights-Structured-Kenan-Modpack**
